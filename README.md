# MoodPlay

MoodPlay is an interactive music player web app made using React that changes music depending on your mood. It detects your mood using an emotion detection model that's  served through a custom API. The site's theme and playlist then changes to match the mood. The site offers an easy-to-use layout, along with a clean and minimalist look designed to keep users engaged.  

(Currently still WIP)
